FIXES
Esc/Cancel in AppDF Load dialog wrong behaviour -> check why .click adds more and more listeners but not replace them
Find a way to push .show event when there will be havy actions after that. Something like flush. Could help for prev item as well.
allow JPG images in small and large promos
add validation about screenshot image size while saving, indeed check image size once when loading, then save to a variable and just use it
Allow empty package name for full version field 
make localization optional loading while default language required where needed
return error message from ApkParser

REFACTORING
remove all non-validation logic from validation code

FEATURES
Multiple screenshot adding
Add XSD checking during import
Make end validation waiting for the callbacks (for example image size)
move langs from drop-down to main tabs when a tab is deleted

SPECIFICATION
Information about each attribute if it is optional or not
Add size and resolution attributes to the APK files and images to better handle feed exchange case when files are not local
