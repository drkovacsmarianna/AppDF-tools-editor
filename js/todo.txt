FIXES
check browser compatibility and show unsupported message
Esc/Cancel in AppDF Load dialog wrong behaviour -> check why .click adds more and more listeners but not replace them
Find a way to push .show event when there will be havy actions after that. Something like flush. Could help for prev item as well.
allow JPG images in small and large promos
Add checking that appicon is a square
add validation about screenshot image size while saving, indeed check image size once when loading, then save to a variable and just use it
SPEED UP!
Allow empty package name for full version field 
make localization optional loading while default language required where needed
return error message from ApkParser

When loading AppDF check that needed file exist
Load files when load AppDF
Create one field for full description with set of rules of converting it -> change editor, like add more help
