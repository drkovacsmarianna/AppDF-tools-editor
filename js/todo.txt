Hi Joe,

Will you have time this week to edit English texts?

Here are the webpages that needs to be edited:
http://www.onepf.org/
http://www.onepf.org/appdf/
http://www.onepf.org/openiab/
http://www.onepf.org/follow/
http://www.onepf.org/contribute/

Do you remember how to edit the pages in GitHub?

What you need to do:

1. Open GitHub, make sure you are logged in

2. Open repository that corresponds to onepf.org website:
http://www.github.com/onepf/onepf.org

3. Fork it (press the Fork button in the top right corner)

4. Edit the HTML pages at GitHub. They are located in the "public" folder in "Code" section. For exmaple HTML webpage that corresponds to "http://www.onepf.org/follow/" is located in "public/follow/index.html"

5. After one page is edited make Pull Request

Best regards,
Vassili

---------------

Allow JPG images in small and large promos. Right now only PNG images are allows in small and large promo. We need to add JPG as well.

FIXES
Esc/Cancel in AppDF Load dialog wrong behaviour -> check why .click adds more and more listeners but not replace them
add validation about screenshot image size while saving, indeed check image size once when loading, then save to a variable and just use it
Allow empty package name for full version field 
make localization optional loading while default language required where needed
return error message from ApkParser

REFACTORING
remove all non-validation logic from validation code

FEATURES
Add XSD checking during import
move langs from drop-down to main tabs when a tab is deleted

SPECIFICATION
Information about each attribute if it is optional or not
Add size and resolution attributes to the APK files and images to better handle feed exchange case when files are not local 

TODO
* Make a page about AppDF parsers
* Option to download AppDF editor as a ZIP file to take away
* Add AppLand categories

* A script to automate publishing from GitHub to onepf.org
